        <h1>How I Got My Books</h1>
        <p class="page-description">My uncle on my mother's side passed away recently, 
            in the will he left me with his prized book collection. I originally thought the collection 
            was going to be a few books, no more than twenty. However, after arriving to the storage 
            locker detailed in the will I was surprised with a plethora of novels that no one in the 
            family had any idea about. My uncle had collected so many novels that it filled a 1,200 
            square foot storage locker, of which I am now the...proud...owner of. I have no room in my 
            small studio apartment for any of these books so I thought I would open up this bookshop site
            to see if anyone would be willing to buy these books. I have researched the prices for and 
            cataloged every book in this collection so that customers would have an easy time perusing 
            my collection. I am hoping to get rid of these books fast and I am desperately looking for 
            buyers. I am willing to sell in bulk for a reduced price. 
            Please I need to get rid of these books. If you know anyone who may want to purchase 
            one or all of my books please share this website with them. My contact information 
            can be found in the Contact page.</p>
