## Description

This is my first independent project in Visual Studio. This project is a functional website for a fictitious business used for the purpose of displaying my skills in utilizing html and css developement processes. The website includes three pages; the first a landing page for the business detailing main products and services provided by the business, the second a secondary page displaying additional products and services not detailed in the landing page, then the third page where the user can submit a message to the company to request more information or perform some other action.
