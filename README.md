## Description

This is my first independent project in Visual Studio. This project is a functional website for a fictitious business used for the purpose of displaying my skills in utilizing html and css developement processes. The website includes three pages; the first a landing page for the business detailing main products and services provided by the business, the second a secondary page displaying additional products and services not detailed in the landing page, then the third page where the user can submit a message to the company to request more information. 

## User Types 

- **Thrill Seeker** is the type of reader that lives for a fast paced action packed story. From witnessing the travel party fighting a dragon attop the highest tower of a castle, to a world saving mission performed in perfect strategy by an elite military squad. 
- **Sleuth** is the kind of reader who is able to figure out the end of a mystery book before reaching the end. This reader is always on the hunt for the mystery novel that finally catches them with a surprise they would have never expected. 
- **Info-maniac** is an individual simply looking to learn as much as they possibly can. Normally reaching for the history or science books, this reader wants to put their brain to work and absorb as much information as they possibly can.
